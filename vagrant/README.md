Use timeline with Vagrant
=========================

1. Start vagrant using the <code>vagrant up</code> command.
2. Get a cup of coffee, because the first startup requires the installation of some libraries from source and this may take a while.
3. After that you can access the example from outside the vagrant box using port 5000 (i.e., open http://localhost:5000/).

tested with Vagrant 1.8.1.
