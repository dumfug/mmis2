## requirements
#### Vagrant:
used version: Vagrant 1.8.1

## how to start
1. go into vagrant folder and run <code>vagrant up</code>.<br>
    Then drink a coffee, because a few python libraries needs a
    lot of time for installation ;-)

2. After finishing the first step the page can be found under
http://localhost:5000/
